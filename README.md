### A basic scores-tracking app developed while learning introductory DOM
#### How it works:
* Pressing either the ```Player 1``` or ```Player 2```  button adds to the respective player's score. 
* The game is over when either of the players reaches the predefined ```Playing to: ``` score, after which it nolonger allows clicking of the two buttons.
* Pressing the ```Reset``` button reverts the scores back to zero, allowing the buttons to now be pressable (That word exists, no? If no, please overlook the error.)

##### PS: UI styling is in the works :)
